**"NFM"** comes from "**N**ot **F**ile **M**anager" - a WPF-based hierarchical data manager for windows with:

* modern UI
* flexible layout system
* drag-n-drop-able multitabs interface
* multilingual support (changeable in run-time without restarting app)
* themes support (changeable in run-time without restarting app)

Also application was developed with add-in model in mind and implementation showcase **local file system** add-in.

Code base was imported from local Perforce v2010 server where I've managed it during somewhere around **2009-2010**.
