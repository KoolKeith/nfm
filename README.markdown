**"NFM"** comes from "**N**ot **F**ile **M**anager" - a WPF-based hierarchical data manager for windows with modern UI, flexible layout system, drag-n-drop-able multitabs interface, multilingual and themes support (both changeable in run-time without restarting app). Also application was developed with add-in model in mind and implementation showcase local file system add-in. Code base was exported from local Perforce v2010 server where I've managed it during somewhere around 2009-2010. Currently project is frozen since I have no time for it.
